<h3 align="center"> AWS Cloud Infrastructure Deployment and Networking Showcase </h3>

##

I have completed a hands-on journey into the world of AWS to showcase my skills and understanding of various key concepts.

**Launching a Single EC2 Instance (Public Subnet):**
I began by demonstrating my proficiency in launching a single EC2 instance in a public subnet. This instance was made accessible over the internet via SSH, showcasing my ability to set up secure remote access.

**Deploying Two EC2 Instances (Linux and Windows) in Different Subnets:**
Next, I took on the challenge of launching not one, but two EC2 instances. I deployed a Linux instance in a public subnet, emphasizing its accessibility from the internet. Simultaneously, I set up a Windows Server instance in a private subnet, ensuring it had internet connectivity for essential updates and patches. Moreover, I configured SSH and RDP access for efficient administrative purposes, highlighting my skills in network and security configurations.

**Creating a Private VPN in AWS Cloud:**
I extended my capabilities by creating my very own private Virtual Private Network (VPN) within the AWS Cloud environment. This demonstrated my expertise in network architecture and secure communication.

**Hosting a WordPress Website with Load Balancing:**
In my final endeavor, I launched an EC2 instance equipped with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. This instance served as the host for a WordPress website, offering a real-world scenario. To enhance reliability and scalability, I implemented Load Balancing across two availability zones.

Throughout this project, I not only gained hands-on experience but also reinforced my understanding of essential AWS services and best practices. The goal was not just to complete tasks but to do so with precision, ensuring the security and efficiency of the systems I designed and deployed.
